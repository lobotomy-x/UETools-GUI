	Sets overlay window to { 0, 0 } size when menu isn't active or target window isn't in focus.
	Should only be used as an emergency solution for Windows 24H2+ black screen glitch as it disables all of background rendering features.

	#define WAIT_FOR_TITLE_INIT

	Delays the GUI initialization loop until the core title classes are valid.

	Use cases:
	- When loading as an ASI plugin (early injection).
	- To prevent crashes when accessing SDK pointers before the engine is fully set up.

	Note: This will block the initialization thread (but not the main title thread) until the title is ready.
